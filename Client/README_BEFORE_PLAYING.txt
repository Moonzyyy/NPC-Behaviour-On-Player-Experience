This is a research project on "Player Experience in a multiplayer and singleplayer environment"!

You will be in a world with different NPCs having a conversation with them. However, their mood changes depending on what you as a player do.
They will also remember you and your actions.
The game is supposed to always have continous gameplay as the NPCs will constantly change their mood depending on the player actions.

!!Please Use your discord name or a very unique name for the game and do not use anything else!!
After playing you will be put in a 10 minute cooldown period. However, do keep playing the game multiple times!
Please don't use any bad language with the conversational NPC. It could cause it to break!

After having played the game enough times please answer the Questionnaire down below! Please do write as honest as possible as responses are 
recorded and used for my research project:
