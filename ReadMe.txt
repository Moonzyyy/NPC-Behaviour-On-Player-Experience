This is my 3rd Year Project (Dissertation) written for the University of Southampton supervised by Kirk Martinez.

"Player Experience in a Singleplayer and Multiplayer Changing World."

A project based on NPCs remembering player actions and acting towards it via having their own mood value and a mood value towards the player.
A conversation NPC, done using OpenAI API, was also added to allow players to experience various "intelligent" NPCs.

The project was created in a way to allow for further research and modding of NPCS.
